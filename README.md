# Horse-health-prediction
# Project Title
With the various medical indicators predict the health outcomes of horses.

# Overview
I went over the training train and test csv files, sample_submission file had no need to be used. I first downloaded and uploaded the files, looked at the data types, looked for missing values and duplicates, dropped the duplicates and removed the missing values.
My model predicts that the age of the horse does predict its health outcome.
My challenge was having to go back and forth between the two files, "test and train"

# Summary of work done
Data types
Handling of outliers
Dropped duplicate
Removed missing values
Data visualization

# Data Visualization
Through ploting data I could see the trend of the older horses having the need of surgery thus the older the horse, the poor the health outcome.

# Problem function
Working through to see the outcome of horse health
# Training
Had struggles training kept running into errors
# Conclusion
I could tell from the distribution that of the data that the older the horse and the mucousal membrane the more likely to live or die
# Future work
With more practice hopefully I get to do more projects from any source.
